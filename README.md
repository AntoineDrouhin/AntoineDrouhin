### Hi, I am Antoine Drouhin

- 💽 I love data storage problematics
- 👨‍💻 I love programming
- 📙 I am addicted to learning! And about anything, I have and had many hobies and enjoy the process of learning new things. 
- 🔬I have been using several programming languages or database technologies but I always prioritize underlying concepts and the trade-offs they involve rather than implementation details. This allows me to not be tied with any technology 🙌
