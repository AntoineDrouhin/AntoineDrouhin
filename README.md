### Hi, I am Antoine Drouhin 

- 🤓 I'm a Software Engineer. Working
- 👷‍♂️ I am currently working at [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/) as a "Manager, Engineering"
- 💽 My current field of action are APIs and Databases.
- 👨‍💻 I love programming.
- 📙 I enjoy learning a LOT! And about anything, which allows me to be familiar with several disciplines such as algorithm, software architecture, project management or even woodworking 🪓 and design 👨‍🎨...
- 🔬I have been using several programming languages or database technologies but I always prioritize underlying concepts and the trade-offs they involve rather than implementation details. This allows me to not be tied with any technology 🙌.
- 🏡 I live in Brittany, France with my family and work full-time remotely.
